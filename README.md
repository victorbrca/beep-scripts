# beep-scripts

A repo containing a collection of [beep](https://github.com/spkr-beep/beep) scripts. Beep scripts are very usefull on headless home servers to indicate boot completion (or even tasks, like scripts).

For each script there's a respective wave file that can be used to preview the audio output of the script.

Please refer to the main beep repo for instructions on how to install and configure beep. Once beep is installed and working, you can use the scripts on this repo.
